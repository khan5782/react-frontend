# Need Pets

## Tech Used

Created a react front end that interacts with an api from [another project that I created](https://github.com/khan5782/ExpressFinal). The two projects together show my understanding of full stack application development. 

## Project Functionality

Need pets allows the user to adopt any sort of pet if it has not been adopted by anyone else. If a user deletes his accounts all his pets would be sent to the unadopted list.
